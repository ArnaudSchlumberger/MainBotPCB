# MainBotPCB

This project is part of Robot Télécom Strasbourg's work as part of our participation to the French Robot Cup.

See our Github page here: https://github.com/AssociationRobotTelecomStrasbourg

And our website (quite empty yet :/ ) here :https://associationrobottelecomstrasbourg.github.io/

MainBotPCB is the PCB that will contain the majority of the  components and connections required for our main robot to work, hence the original name :) .
